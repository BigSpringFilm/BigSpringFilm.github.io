Why pay lots of money for a toy you KNOW you are going to break?  Instead let's build our own so we know we can repair it easily and cheaply, plus we'll get to choose our own components, and later on when we want to scale up we can just remove the brains, build a new frame and attach bigger motors!  Moar power!  Mwahahahahahahah!

### Pilot Software

Let's start with the brains of the matter, there are quite a few choices out there, I'm going to stick to the open source stuff so we can hack on it.

[Ardupilot](http://ardupilot.com/) is a nice place to start, take a robot add an arduino and you got yourself an autonomous pet to do your bidding.  
They also made the [Mission Planner](http://planner.ardupilot.com/) software you'll see everywhere
They seem to be sponsored or related to [diydrones](http://diydrones.com/)

[pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/choice) seems to be a popular choice albeit with dedicated hardware 
and bit higher of a price this seems to be the feature rich option

[Paparazzi](http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Main_Page)

[Open Pilot](https://www.openpilot.org/)

Turnigy 9X open source firmware:

here’s the radio:

and then the frame here
<http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__85254__Diatone_Blade_200_Class_Micro_Multirotor_Frame_Kit.html>

notice you can choose parts that go with it below.

or there are whole kits on amazon:

<http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010FMGUS8?psc=1>

notice that still needs the radio like the 9Xr above
