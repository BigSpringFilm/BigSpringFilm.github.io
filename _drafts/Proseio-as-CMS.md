Ok, so let’s talk about [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) an amazing service from  [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org)

This gives an easy to use graphical user interface to jekyll blogs and many other static sites, there are a couple of good guides out there already

I wont’ duplicate their efforts here, but I will suggest a few tweaks, 

it is important to note that you can run this yourself as they have source code available here:
