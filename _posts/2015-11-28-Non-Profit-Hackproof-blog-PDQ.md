So I wanted to show a friend of mine that a static website can be a much better experience than starting out with a php/mysql based website.  
To prove the point I started looking around for jekyll templates, and happened to search for nonprofit as well in the search term mix, lo and behold I come across this:
[free-nonprofit-starter-website](http://smartergiving.org/free-nonprofit-starter-website/)
they have a github repo here for it: [github.com/smartergiving/free-nonprofit-starter-website](https://github.com/smartergiving/free-nonprofit-starter-website)

The things I like it about it.  First and firemost itâ€™s completely static and can be hosted for free, relying for the time being on external services (stripe and tinyletter).  So the next question became well can I theme it and add in some other external services like disqus and facebook comments?

I forked it and made an example site here: [bigspringfilm.github.io](http://bigspringfilm.github.io/) after some tooling around with fb comments I decided I needed to some serious evaluation before recommending a solutions to anyone.  So I dug into disqus...

By this time I was having so much fun with it all I forked again and began dismantling it inspecting the pieces and seeing how I could put them back together in interesting ways. I am now writing this very blog into that fork, mainly so I can continue to dissect and learn about running a jekyll blog so that I can help others to blog without having to rely on php and mysql.  And also just to document as I go in this blog, perhaps my musings will be useful to others.

So you can see the source code here: [https://github.com/joshuacox/joshuacox.github.io](https://github.com/joshuacox/joshuacox.github.io)
