Do you need an [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack) in a hurry?  Then follow the instructions on this page:

[Elksible](http://joshuacox.github.io/elksible/)

You will need your own logstash configuration, which you can find an example of here:

[Example Logstash conf file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuacox/confstash/master/logstash.conf)

then you merely need to incant `make server` and you should have a running elkstack on whatever you specified as ‘elkhost’ in your `/etc/ansible/hosts` file
