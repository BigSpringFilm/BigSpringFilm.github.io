#Happy New Year folks!

Have you tried habitica?  Your life has now been transformed into the latest form of augmented reality, you are now living the video game.  
Earn XP and gold for doing things like cleaning the catbox, laundry, brushing your teeth, randomly find eggs from which you can hatch mammals like wolves.  
But only if you find a bottle of nail polish first to color the animal with..... Or something like that.

There have been a few of these things in the past.  That is a todo list combined with an RPG. 
what makes this one interesting is that they open sourced it

[github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg)

And not just the web app, on their main page you can find the android application:

[github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-android](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-android)

the iOs app:

[github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-ios](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-ios)

And much, much more, including email servers, chrome extensions, more experimental phone [builds](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-mobile) that use angularJs and phonegap.  

Kudos to them for open sourcing everything, I think I'll join and actually buy from this company.  The only thing that would make be feel better is if they were a [coop](http://www.webhosting.coop/)
