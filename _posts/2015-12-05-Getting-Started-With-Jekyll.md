Let’s Build a modern website using the static generator from Ruby

First I want to show this great playlist that is an excellent breakdown of how to get started with building a website, it happens to use jekyll, so I thought it would be a great addition to the collection here, that I’m building for jekyll, as this covers many of the basics I have not covered yet, and may not ever

##### How to build a responsive website from start to finish

#### History

Jekyll was start in late 2008 by github cofounder Tom Preston-Warner here was his original blog post about it

#### Going further

There are a couple of good guides out there:

Please post in the comments if you know of any other guides that are well written and easily understandable for those new and perhaps not so comfortable with the command line.

And notice the categories of this blog are completely dominated by Jekyll at the moment:

[http://joshuacox.github.io/categories/](http://joshuacox.github.io/categories/)

Keep an eye on that page as I plan on documenting everything I do there so that I can help others accomplish this easily
