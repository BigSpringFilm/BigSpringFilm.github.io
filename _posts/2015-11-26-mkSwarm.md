While playing around with docker swarm and following the official walkthrough:

[Install swam with Machine](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/install-w-machine/)

I decided to create a Makefile to test it out:

[joshuacox.github.io/mkswarm/](http://joshuacox.github.io/mkswarm/)

the instruction are all there, should be easy enough, let me know if anyone has issues with it.  And give the `make benchmark` a try and see how fast your machine is
